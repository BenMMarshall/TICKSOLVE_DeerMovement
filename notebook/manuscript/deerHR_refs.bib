Theory predicts that spatial and temporal scales should co‐vary in most ecological processes and that the most limiting factors should drive habitat selection at coarse ecological scales, but be less influential at finer scales. Using detailed location data on roe deer
              Capreolus capreolus
              inhabiting the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, we investigated habitat selection at several spatial and temporal scales. We tested 1) whether time‐varying patterns were governed by factors reported as having the largest effects on fitness, 2) whether the trade‐off between forage and predation risks differed among spatial and temporal scales and 3) if spatial and temporal scales are positively associated. We analysed the variation in habitat selection within the landscape and within home ranges at monthly intervals, with respect to land‐cover type and proxys of food and cover over seasonal and diurnal temporal scales. The fine‐scale temporal variation follows a nycthemeral cycle linked to diurnal variation in human disturbance. The large‐scale variation matches seasonal plant phenology, suggesting food resources being a greater limiting factor than lynx predation risk. The trade‐off between selection for food and cover was similar on seasonal and diurnal scale. Habitat selection at the different scales may be the consequence of the temporal variation and predictability of the limiting factors as much as its association with fitness. The landscape of fear might have less importance at the studied scale of habitat selection than generally accepted because of the predator hunting strategy. Finally, seasonal variation in habitat selection was similar at the large and small spatial scales, which may arise because of the marked philopatry of roe deer. The difference is supposed to be greater for wider ranging herbivores.},

We observed an abrupt population decline in 2000, which may severely threaten the sustainability of this population. We evaluated the hypothesis that competition by fallow deer may be a principal cause of this decline. By a new and innovative methodology, we modelled the spatial distribution of fallow deer density (FDD) in the study area to show that 1) habitat quality for roe deer was an inverse function of FDD, 2) habitat apportionment between fallow and roe deer increased as a function of FDD and – by applying structural equation modelling – 3) FDD was superior to habitat composition in explaining observed variations in home range size and probably in habitat quality for roe deer. This analysis is the first to document that inter‐specific competition may influence the spatial behaviour of a deer species leading to poor phenotypic performance in the inferior competitor. We conclude that the conservation of this relict population would benefit by reducing fallow deer numbers at Castelporziano and from other measures aimed to decrease the level of inter‐specific competition.},

                Large herbivores respond to fluctuations in predation and hunting risk. The temporal scale of risk heterogeneity affects behavioral responses and determines the usefulness of metrics to quantify them. We present a conceptual framework to link anti‐predator responses to risk fluctuations and appropriate metrics, based on temporal scale. We applied this framework to investigate movement responses of roe deer (
                Capreolus capreolus
                ) to hunting risk, measured using movement rate and home range size. Because movements are also affected by reproductive phases, we considered potential effects of the rut in parallel to hunting risk. We compared movements of male and female roe deer in a protected site versus 2 hunted sites during and outside the hunting season and rut. We detected differences in movement rates in response to different hunting management practices. We did not detect effects for hunting regimes or between sexes during the rut when using home range size as the response variable. During the hunting season, movement rates were lower in the hunted sites than in the protected site, irrespective of sex. We did not observe differences in movement rates among sites outside of the hunting season. Males had higher movement rates than females during the rut in only 1 site. Our findings supported the hypothesis that roe deer decrease movements when exposed to high hunting risk. The effect of the rut on movements was negligible except for 1 study site. We suggest that movement rate is a more useful metric than home range size for assessing movement responses to hunting. © 2018 The Wildlife Society

Proportions of migratory deer were similar for fawns and adults and for males and females. We documented a mixed migration strategy, with most deer migrating once to the winter range in years of heavy snowfalls, but many deer migrating inconsistently or only for a short period to the winter range in one year with very scarce snowfalls. Seasonal home-range sizes were similar for migratory and stationary deer, except in a winter with very shallow snow when migrators used unusually large home ranges. In all seasons, migrators showed a lower within home range site fidelity than did stationary deer. Our results indicate that seasonal migrations may be a common strategy exhibited by roe deer living in mountain areas to avoid deep snow, and that variability in climatic conditions might be responsible for the development of variable spatial strategies.},

              The link between spatio-temporal resource patterns and animal movement behaviour is a key ecological process, however, limited experimental support for this connection has been produced at the home range scale. In this study, we analysed the spatial responses of a resident large herbivore (roe deer
              Capreolus capreolus
              ) using an in situ manipulation of a concentrated food resource. Specifically, we experimentally altered feeding site accessibility to roe deer and recorded (for 25 animal-years) individual responses by GPS tracking. We found that, following the loss of their preferred resource, roe deer actively tracked resource dynamics leading to more exploratory movements, and larger, spatially-shifted home ranges. Then, we showed, for the first time experimentally, the importance of site fidelity in the maintenance of large mammal home ranges by demonstrating the return of individuals to their familiar, preferred resource despite the presence of alternate, equally-valuable food resources. This behaviour was modulated at the individual level, where roe deer characterised by a high preference for feeding sites exhibited more pronounced behavioural adjustments during the manipulation. Together, our results establish the connections between herbivore movements, space-use, individual preference, and the spatio-temporal pattern of resources in home ranging behaviour.},

              Data on 22 radio‐collared adult female roe deer
              Capreolus capreolus
              in the Chizé forest were used to test whether their home‐range size was influenced by resource availability and reproductive status. As roe deer females are income breeders and invest heavily in each reproductive attempt, they should be limited by energetic constraints. Thus it was expected that: (1) heavier females should have larger home ranges; (2) that home‐range size should decrease with increasing vegetation biomass; (3) home‐range size should increase with increasing reproductive effort (i.e. females with two fawns at heel should have larger home ranges than those with one fawn, which should have larger home range than females without fawns). To test these predictions, variation in spring–summer home‐range size was studied in 2001 and 2002, using 95\% kernel home‐range estimation. Results showed that females do not adjust their home‐range size in response to body mass or age. Home‐range size increased with increasing reproductive success, but the magnitude of the change varied over the period of maternal care. Finally, although their home‐range size decreased with increasing plant biomass (slope =−0.11,
              se
              =0.065), female roe deer at Chizé did not fully compensate for declines in food availability by increasing home‐range size.},

              The knowledge of the ability of a species to adapt to a human‐altered environment is important for developing wildlife management plans and, in turn, for conservation of the species. Radio‐tracking was used to examine the effects of partial food or cover removal (owing to agricultural changes) on the spacing patterns and habitat use of adult roe deer
              Capreolus
              capreolus in a mixed wood/agricultural Mediterranean area, during spring–summer 1996–97. For both sexes, there were no changes in home‐range and core‐area sizes, or in inter‐fix distances, after food (field ploughing) or cover (crop harvesting) removal. After food removal, both sexes shifted their home ranges and core areas, spending more time in woodland and less time in the ploughed field. This suggests a change in feeding habits. In addition, similar responses by males and females indicate that their energetic requirements are comparable during the territorial/reproductive period. After removal of cover, males neither shifted their home ranges and core areas, nor changed their habitat use, whereas females responded with significant shifts (by
              c.
              90\%) of the core area, and a significant decrease in the proportion of daytime spent in the harvested field. Thus, crop harvesting in this period (May/June) has different effects on the two sexes, with adult females being much less tolerant than males. Differential responses to cover removal were related to the different security requirements of the two sexes around the period of parturition.},

	abstract = {Most animals restrain their movement activities to familiar areas which leads to home ranges. Although understanding both establishment and shifts of home ranges is highly relevant for basic science and conservation, pinpointing the factors that shape the dynamics of home ranges remains a challenge. Evidently home ranges are influenced by the underlying landscape. Landscape composition, i.e., the fraction of different land cover types, has recently been shown to affect home range size. Yet, the explicit spatial configuration of the landscape, a factor which is known to be of central importance in spatial ecology, is not taken into account by most studies. We quantify the effect of landscape configuration on summer home range sizes across multiple spatio‐temporal scales using GPS data from two behaviorally distinct ungulate species, red (
              Cervus elaphus
              ) and roe deer (
              Capreolus capreolus
              ), in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. We show that the spatial configuration of the landscape is the dominant factor explaining home range size. Furthermore, we find that the shape of the relationship between home range size and landscape configuration depends on a species' habitat requirements: while roe deer decrease their home range size with increasing landscape patchiness, the relationship is hump‐shaped for red deer. Our results are robust at all tested spatio‐temporal scales.},

	abstract = {The ranging behaviour, activity and social organization of sympatric populations of Reeves' muntjac (
              Muntiacus reevesi
              ) and roe deer (
              Capreolus capreolus
              ) in a mainly commercial coniferous forest in eastern England were studied by means of radio‐tracking techniques. Muntjac showed no seasonal changes in range size; muntjac bucks had significantly larger ranges than does at all times of the year. For roe deer there were significant seasonal changes in home‐range size; bucks had largest ranges in the winter months and smallest ranges in September‐October, whereas does had largest ranges during January‐February and minimum ranges during May‐June. There was no seasonal change in the number or size of muntjac core areas; bucks always had larger and more numerous core areas than does. Neither was there a seasonal change in the number or size of roe deer core areas; whilst there was no difference in the number of core areas for roe bucks and does, those of bucks were significantly smaller. There was no seasonal change in daily distance travelled by muntjac bucks or does, or roe bucks, but there was a significant seasonal trend for roe does, whose daily distances travelled were longest during January‐February and shortest during May‐June.

            Spatial organization of muntjac consisted of groups of overlapping doe ranges but exclusive back ranges; these overlapped with one or more groups of doe ranges. During the summer, roe deer buck and doe ranges overlapped, and some doe ranges were shared with other adult does, but buck ranges were exclusive. During the winter, roe deer were more wide‐ranging and mixed more freely. There was no evidence for spatial separation of muntjac and roe deer; minimum convex polygon ranges overlapped and core areas often coincided. Mean annual activity was 69.3 ± 1.5\% for muntjac and 56.4 ± 1.8\% for roe deer. Mean length of active periods was significantly greater for muntjac than roe deer, and roe deer had significantly longer inactive periods. For muntjac there were peaks of activity at dusk and dawn, with lower levels of activity during the day and night. For roe deer the dawn and dusk peaks were more clearly defined, and at most times of the year nocturnal activity was higher than diurnal activity.
            These results are discussed in relation to the physiology of the two species and their patterns of space and food utilization, and the evidence for resource partitioning between the two species is evaluated. It was shown that neither muntjac nor roe deer had an effect on the ranging behaviour, activity and social organization of the other species, but that at very high densities muntjac can have an impact on established roe deer populations by changing their pattern of habitat utilization and by locally reducing their numbers.},

	abstract = {Non‐consumptive effects of predators result from the cost of responses to perceived risk. Prey modulate risk exposure through flexible habitat selection at multiple scales which, in interaction with landscape constraints, determines their use of risky habitats. Identifying the relative contributions of landscape constraints and habitat selection to risk exposure is a critical first step towards a mechanistic understanding of non‐consumptive effects.
            Here, we provide an integrative multi‐scale study of roe deer spatial responses to variable hunting pressure along a landscape gradient of open habitats and dispersed refuges. Between low‐risk and high‐risk periods, we investigated shifts in 1) home‐range location, 2) probability of using risky habitats (between‐habitat scale) and 3) distance to the nearest refuge (within‐habitat scale). For 2) and 3), we disentangled the contributions of landscape constraints and habitat selection to risky habitat use.
            We found that when risk was high, roe deer did not shift their home‐range, but generally decreased their use of risky habitats, and sometimes reduced their distance to cover (particularly older animals). There was a functional response in between‐habitat selection, with animals living in more open landscapes responding more than those living in landscapes with more refuges. However, individuals living in more open landscapes avoided open risky habitat less. Finally, we found that among‐individual variation in risk exposure was generally, but not always, minimized by habitat selection across gradients of landscape constraints.
            To our knowledge, this is the first study simultaneously documenting prey responses to risk at the within‐habitat, between‐habitat and home‐range scales. Our results support the view that between‐habitat selection acts at a higher hierarchical level than within‐habitat selection, and provide a framework for disentangling the contributions of habitat selection and landscape constraints to risk exposure. Selection cannot always compensate for landscape constraints, indicating a need for further investigation of the processes underlying habitat selection.},
