## Estimating Preference and Probability of Occurrence

For Roe Deer we used the functional connectivity maps created as part of CITE CAMERA TRAP PAPER that was based on habitat selection models detailed by CITE DEER MOVEMENT PAPER.
Briefly, this involved creating a population-level habitat selection model, projecting those selection estimates across the landscape, using the selection as a proxy for landscape conductance, and running a series of random shortest-paths between woodland patches.
The major advantage of this approach was via the ability to calibrate the randomness/diffuseness of the random paths based on the observed movement paths of tracked Roe Deer.

For Fallow Deer, we lacked sufficient movement data to completely generate connectivity based on habitat selection and movement models (i.e., CITE CAMERA TRAP PAPER; CITE DEER MOVEMENT PAPER).
Instead we followed the workflow outlined by @prima_comprehensive_2024, using species distribution modelling to generate reasonable estimations of landscape resistance and then applying a circuit-theory approach to determine how interconnected selected woodland patches were [@mcrae_using_2008; @mcrae_conserving_2016].

We collated occurrence data from GBIF and NBN Atlas [@gbif_gbiforg_2025; @nbn_trust_national_2025] for the Fallow Deer, using searches for "*Dama dama*" [@gbif_fallow_2025].
Full data references are provided in subsequent Appendix.
<!-- NBN has specific DOIs to add from the README files that came with the download -->
We downloaded all records within the UK, for all species, resulting in `r nrow(tar_occData_fallow)` occurrence locations of Fallow Deer.

We filtered the records as to only include those made via human observations, were recorded to sub-25m accuracy, and had verified species identities.
Once filtered we used CoordinateCleaner [@coordinatecleaner] to eliminate records that likely contained location errors on a species-by-species basis.
Namely we removed records within 10km of a capital, within 1km of a country centroid, had identical decimal latitude and longitudes, had zero in either latitude or longitude, or were identified as outliers. 
We used the quantile method of identifying outliers, removing those records beyond 5 times the interquartile range of minimum distances to the next neighbour.
Finally, we thinned the both the data so that no occurrence shared a raster cell with another occurrence.

We generated a number pseudo-absences data points for both target taxa equal to three times the number of true-occurrences available; we repeated this process 10 times allowing for multiple model fits [@barbetmassin_selecting_2012].
We limited the area pseudo-absences generated within to 6.2km of a known Fallow Deer occurrence.
As Fallow Deer have not uniformly spread across the UK, this limit excluded areas where Fallow Deer have not, as of yet, had the opportunity to colonise.
We weighted the pseudo-absences using a bias layer to mitigate the impacts of the sampling biases associated with the true-occurrence data.
For our bias layer, we used the human footprint index [@mu_annual_2021; @mu_global_2022] that combines a variety of human activities and land conversions into a single metric, and could serve as a proxy for the likelihood of observing our target species (Fig. \@ref(fig:fallowOccurence)).

```{r fallowOccurence, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.height=5, fig.width=3, fig.align="centre", fig.pos = "h", fig.cap="fallow deer, occurrence data"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "fallow_occurrenceData_plot.png"))
```

For valuables in the models we made use of a number of data sources.
We used land cover type as described by the 2023 UKCEH land cover maps, which is a 25m resolution classified raster originally based on Sentinel-2 imagery [@morton_land_2024].
The UKCEH land cover data comprises of 21 land cover classes, broadly following the Biodiversity Broad Habitats [@jackson_guidance_2000].
We recategorised these 21 land cover types categories into 10 more general categories (Tab. \@ref(tab:landcoverTable).

```{r landcoverTable, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
landcoverReclass <- read.csv(here("tables", "reclassificationUKCEH.csv"))
kableExtra::kbl(landcoverReclass, caption = "Overview of the reclassifcation of UKCEH land cover classes for inclusion into the habitat selection models.",
             col.names = c("UKCEH land cover class",
                           "UKCEH land cover identifier",
                           "Reclassified category"), booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))

```

We used "woody linear feature" (i.e., hedgerows) data from UKCEH [@scholefield_woody_2016] that maps hedgerows across the UK (e.g., woodland) as polylines.
The features are based on Ordnance Survey maps and the 2007 UKCEH Land Cover Map [@morton_final_2011].
We acquired road data from OS map open GOV licensed [@ordnance_survey_os_2024].

We included the following variables in the species distribution models: Distance to woodland, Distance to hedgerow, Distance to human settlement (i.e., urban and sub-urban) as continuous variables; and the following as binary variables: Cropland, Deciduous Broadleaf Forest, Tall Grassland, Evergreen Needleleaf Forest, Short Grassland, Open Shrubland, Barren, Permanent Wetland, Other land covers.

We used the biomod2 package to manage species distribution modelling [@biomod2].
We fitted a variety of models: Artificial Neural Network, Boosted Regression Trees, Generalized Linear Model, and Random Forest. 
We intended to run Maximum Entropy and eXtreme Gradient Boosting Training, but the inclusion of categoric variables precluded their use.
We used stratified cross validation to evaluate model performance, as we were not priorisitisng model transferability [@Muscarella2014].
We balanced stratification based on known occurrences both in x and y dimensions.
We elected to use True Skill Statistic (TSS) as our primary metric of model performance [@shabani_assessing_2018; @allouche_assessing_2006].
Once all models had been complete, we compiled all models into an ensemble model ready for projection to our target landscapes.
We included all models that obtained TSS scores of over 0.25, and weighted models proportionately to their TSS score.
Once the TSS weighted mean ensemble model had been created, we used it to project the probability of occurrence to the Aberdeenshire and Wessex landscapes.

## Translating Preferences into Connectivity

Once we had estimates of selection and effect for all the environmental aspects of interest, we projected those estimated covariates back onto the landscape, resulting in a map of conductance (Fig. \@ref(fig:conductancePlot)).

Despite not having sufficient movement data to create a comparable movement-data-derived habitat selection model as used for the Roe Deer (CITE DEER MOVEMENT PAPER), we could run a similar model to estimate Fallow Deer road crossings likelihood (Possion model formula: used/available ~ crossed road binary + step length + log step length + cos turn angle).
This modelling process mirrored the procedure undertaken for Roe Deer except only examined the likelihood of crossing a road.
For roads we rasterised the road polyline data obtained from @ordnance_survey_os_2024 and used the road crossing coefficient from the Poisson model to create a conductance value for the road cells.
We replaced any areas with 0 conductance with 1e-12 to avoid any dead-ends or any absolute barriers.
We ignored the uncertainty surrounding the selection estimates, instead relying on just the point estimates for the resistance mapping.

We elected not to generate start or end points in patches less than 0.5ha in areas. 
This was due to these patches being unlikely to host deer populations and the reduction in origin patches aided computational costs.
The 0.5 ha threshold meant that 3415 Aberdeen patches and 7564 Wessex patches were included in the generation of random shortest paths, thereby necessitating optimisations for the sake of compute time.

For the Fallow Deer, we followed @prima_comprehensive_2024 and used Omniscape.jl [@landau_omniscapejl_2021], built on Circuitscape.jl [@mcrae_conserving_2016; @anantharaman_circuitscape_2020; @hall_circuitscape_2021], to generate a map of landscape connectivity in both landscapes [@mcrae_using_2008].
We used the previously denoted patches as sources/nodes (all with the same strength).
To aid with computation costs, we selected a block size of 31.
We ensured that the block size was less than one-tenth of the search radius to minimise grid artifacting [@phillips_comparison_2021; @prima_comprehensive_2024].
We based the Omniscape search radius on previously recorded estimates of home range size, based heavily on the data provide by the home range database [@broekman_homerange_2023; @broekman_homerange_2022].
In both case we filtered the home range data to species/group and calculated a mean home range area.
For the Fallow Deer their mean home range suggested a search radius of 1500m.

Once complete, we elected to use the normalised current maps for all subsequent analysis (see Fig. \@ref(fig:fallowWessexConnect) for an example of Fallow Deer connectivity in Wessex).

```{r fallowWessexConnect, echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.height=5, fig.width=3, fig.align="centre", fig.pos = "h", fig.cap="Example of the resulting connectivity map for Fallow deer, Wessex. Values > 1 are channelised flow. Values ~ 1 are diffuse flow matching general flow potential. Values < 1 are impeded flow"}
